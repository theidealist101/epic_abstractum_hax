Epic Abstractum Hax
===================

I think I may be pissing off Aeshaedi with my persistence in cheating in their servers lol

(you can nullify my score if you like, I don't really mind, I'm just having fun building huge things)

Features
--------

- `.fill` command, to fill a whole area with the held node (indicated by punching the corners)
- `.walls` command, same but only fills the vertical sides
- `.replace` command, to set one node type to replace instead of filling everything
- `mirror_z` setting, to mirror everything you place or fill in the YZ-plane (I made this so I could easily make that big building at the north end of the map symmetrical)
- An internal placement queue to allow the other functions to defer placement of nodes beyond the player's reach distance
